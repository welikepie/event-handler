  Event Handler is geeks organising events for other geeks. For over a year now we've been running London JS and other tech events around London. We run the events based around a few simple ideas;

  - An event is made by it's attendees 
  - We want you to walk away having learned something
  - We sell sponsorship not speaking slots

  ## Contact

  To talk to us about speaking at an event, sponsorship or any other question send an email to the team at (email: contact@eventhandler.co.uk text: contact@eventhandler.co.uk).

  ## Be excellent to each other

  We are dedicated to producing the best events. To make the experience enjoyable for everyone – regardless of age, gender, sexuality, religious or ethnic identity – we expect our speakers and attendees to remember about these simple rules;

  - Offensive behaviour (verbal abuse, intimidation, harassment etc.) will not be tolerated
  - Offensive slide decks will not be tolerated
  - Anyone acting like a jerk will be asked to leave
  - If you find something offensive, let us know and we'll investigate it

  Any feedback and suggestions how we can make our events more enjoyable and inclusive are welcome, so don't be shy.
