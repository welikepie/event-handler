          <h4>Things to consider when preparing for your talk</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>When talking in an unfamiliar city</strong> - check the journey from the station/airport to the venue beforehand
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>If your nerves become too much</strong> - Know where the bathrooms are
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>What are you wearing?</strong> - check that your clothes aren't seethrough under bright lights
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Need an internet connection for your presentation?</strong> - Check that there is one!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>If you're presenting from a high stage</strong> - Consider the length of your skirt/kilt
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Check the size of screen you'll be presenting on</strong> - in both pixels and inches/metres
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Doing a long talk?</strong> - take a beverage with you on stage
            </li>
             <li>
              <strong>Know who your audience is</strong>
            </li>
             <li>
              <strong>Don't want your talk recorded/tweeted?</strong> - Tell the organisers before hand
            </li>
             <li>
              <strong>Require Pyrotechnics, Animals, Robots or Cyborg Dogs with Rocket Launchers?</strong> - Check with the organisers!
            </li>
             <li>
              <strong>When taking questions from the audience</strong> - Repeat the questions asked back to the audience. This can be useful for both those who did not hear the question and also if the event is being recorded
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Get familiar with the venue</strong> - know where you will be, where your notes will be and where your slides will be displayed
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Have a dry run of your presentation</strong> - Get used to plugging into a second display and being ready to talk. Get the timing right. It is a good idea to do this with a small audience who can offer you critical feedback, such as colleagues over a lunch break
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>If you're doing an evening talk or staying late for the after-party</strong> - Check how you will get home in the evening! Your journey may not be the same as it was in the day time
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Check your travel plans on the day</strong> - there may be things preventing you (like engineering works) from taking your previously planned route 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Depending on the content of your talk</strong> - you may want to check with the organisers if they have any policies on content they deem problematic
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Back-up your talk</strong> - on USB or to a service like Dropbox, in case you have any problems with your laptop on the day
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>When making your slides with custom fonts/media</strong> - make sure these are embedded within the slidedeck. If you're using someone elses set-up to display your presentation, they may not have these things on hand. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Don't be afraid to ask questions</strong> - If you're unsure about something or just have a request, ask the organisers! They're there to help.
            </li>
