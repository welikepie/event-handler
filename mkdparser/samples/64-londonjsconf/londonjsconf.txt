(image: londonjsconf.png class: full-width)

Through running our monthly meet-up London JS: we've worked with some fantastic speakers, met some amazing people and learnt a whole lot about JavaScript. The community that you've all helped to build up is wonderful and as a way of saying thank you and celebrating JavaScript, we'd like to bring you all together for London JS Conf.

On the 13th of February 2014, we'll be descending on the Prince Charles Cinema for a one-day two-track JavaScript focused day of learning and discovery. We've also planned a range of special events around the conference and we hope you can join us for them.

**The first batch of tickets go on sale on Thursday the 28th of November at 1PM**
