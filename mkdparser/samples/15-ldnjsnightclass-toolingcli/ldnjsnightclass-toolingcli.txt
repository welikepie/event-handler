Title: London JS Night Classes: Modern Tooling on the Command Line
----
Text: 

Join (link: https://www.twitter.com/jack_franklin text: Jack Franklin) in a London JS Night Class dedicated to exploring the possibilities of utilising JavaScript and speeding up development on the Command Line.

There are so many great JS tools and utilities that are exclusively available on the command line. In this workshop we will look at how to set up a command line, including initial configuration, installing useful tools like Node and Node Package Manager (npm), and then delve into more detail into a few of the most popular tools, including Grunt, Yeoman, Mocha, Bower and others.

If you want to take part in this workshop, here's what you'll need:

* A Unix Laptop; a Mac or something that runs Linux.
* You must be an experienced JavaScript developer. Experience with TDD/BDD libraries like Jasmine (or similar) and MV frameworks like Backbone is recommended.
* Node (V0.8 and upwards) and Node Package Manager (npm) installed on your computer.
* Basic knowledge of the command line is preferable but not required.
