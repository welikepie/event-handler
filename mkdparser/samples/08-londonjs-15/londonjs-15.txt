Title: London JS
----
Text: 

With all the new HTML5 APIs and node.js making waves in the backend, it's never been a better time to be a JavaScript developer.

London JS will (try and) meet on a Monday of each month to hear a couple of talks on the exciting new topics that are influencing our field, before retiring to the local pub.

This months, the talks will be:

* Dart - Chris Buckett (link: https://twitter.com/chrisbuckett text: @chrisbuckett)
* JavaScript and Test Driven Development - Ricky Clegg (link: https://twitter.com/ricky_clegg text: @ricky_clegg)
