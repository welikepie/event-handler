Now in it’s fifth year, UXCamp boasts an eclectic mix of talks and discussions from seasoned UX’ers and novices alike; for anyone interested in user experience design, information architecture, usability and more. There are no set talks, nor any product pitches; the content of the day is shaped by all those who attend, anyone can hold a talk or host a discussion.

There will be five batches of tickets released in the coming weeks: Batch One: Monday the 24th of June at 1PM Batch Two: Monday the 1st of July at 1PM Batch Three: Monday the 7th of July at 1PM Batch Four: Monday the 15th of July at 1PM

## What is a BarCamp?

Unlike a traditional conference, a BarCamp is an event which is shaped by the attendees. Rather than having a day of scheduled speakers, you are given the opportunity to present yourself. The goal is to share what you know, learn from others and ignite discussion.

You create the schedule: at the start of the day anyone who wants to has the opportunity to sign up for a speaking slot. What you want to talk about is up to you! Previous sessions have been anything from “Live Wireframing” and “From post-its to personas” to “Visual Note Taking” and “A Hitchhikers guide to Gamification”.

## Who is it for?

UXCamp London is for anyone at all who is interested in User Experience. UXCamp has been host to a broad selection of attendees including seasoned UX practitioners who want to connect with other members of the field and trade ideas, designers and developers who want to learn more about another aspect of creating great products and services & students who want to be more involved in the community and develop their skills.

## How can you get involved?
