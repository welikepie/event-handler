Whilst the work we do is not meant to be hanged on a wall for people to admire, nor is meant to be put in a drawer and forgotten about. Just as we make the products and services we design easy to use, the UX of UX is about communicating your thinking in a way that ensures that what you've defined is easy to understand for the reader. It's about adapting the work you do to the project in question and finding the right balance of making people want to look through your work whilst not spending unnecessary time on making it pretty.

### Who is it for?

This workshop is suitable for anyone starting out in UX, or who's worked with it for a while but is looking to improve the way they present their work. 
 

### Who is it taught by?

The workshop is being hosted Anna Dahlström (link: http://www.twitter.com/annadahlstrom text: @annadahlstrom), an Information Architecure and User Experience consultant. Originally from Sweden, Anna lives and works in London. Having previously worked for Dare; she now works for (link: http://www.byflock.com text: Byflock) and freelances part-time.

### What you'll learn

In this hands on workshop we'll walk through real life examples of why the UX of UX deliverables matter. We'll cover how who the reader is effects the way we should present our work, both on paper and verbally, and how to ensure that the work you do adds value. Coming out of the workshop you'll have practical examples and hands on experience with:

* How to adapt and sell your UX deliverable to the reader (from clients, your team, in house and outsourced developers)
* Guiding principles for creating good UX deliverables (both low and high fidelity)
* Best practice for presentations, personas, user journeys, flows, sitemaps, wireframes and other documents
* Simple, low effort but big impact tools for improving the visual presentation of your UX deliverables
