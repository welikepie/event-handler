<h3>Who is it for?</h3>
<p>This workshop is for curious minds. It is for people who bought an Arduino but don't know quite what to do with it or where to start. It is also for people who find the idea of an Arduino attractive, but need to be convinced.</p>
<p>For those who thought they'd have to learn C to make it work, we'll show you JavaScript can be the solution.</p>
<p>In one evening you will learn how to work with Arduino and Breakout.js to create prototypes and kick-start your ideas. This class will rely on your existing JS, HTML and CSS skills to bring you one step closer to being a Maker.</p>
