Just as we make the products and services we design easy to use, the UX of UX is about communicating your thinking in a way that ensures that what you&#39;ve defined is easy to understand for the reader. It&#39;s about adapting the work you do to the project in question and finding the right balance of making people want to look through your work whilst not spending unnecessary time on making it pretty.</p><h3>Who is it for?</h3><p>This workshop is suitable for anyone starting out in UX, or who&#39;s worked with it for a while but is looking to improve the way they present their work. </p><h3>Who is it taught by?</h3><p>The workshop is being hosted Anna Dahlström (link: http://www.twitter.com/annadahlstrom text: @annadahlstrom), an Information Architecure and User Experience consultant.
