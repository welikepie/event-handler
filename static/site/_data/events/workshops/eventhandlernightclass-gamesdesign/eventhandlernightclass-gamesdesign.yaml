text: "<p>On Tuesday the 11th of February, Award-winning games designer and publisher (link: http://www.twitter.com/jameswallis text: James Wallis) will give you a crash course in creating board-games and card-games.</p><p>(image: james.png class: full-width)</p><p>In modern design, building stuff fast and getting to a working version are key, but making and testing prototypes (code or physical objects) can be enormously time-consuming. Learning how to work with paper prototypes—meta-versions of your design—to iterate the project quickly can save you days. In this workshop James Wallis will teach you to create and flesh out a concept for a simple multi-user system, build a working prototype, watch as other people test it and critique it, and use that criticism to rework the design towards a finished product.</p><h3>Who is it taught by?</h3><p>This fun evening workshop is being hosted by James Wallis (link: http://www.twitter.com/jameswallis text: @jameswallis).
