<p>Ten years ago most websites were small affairs, with perhaps a handful of pages and very simple designs. Today, however, the majority of websites are very different beasts…</p>
<p>There’s no denying that web-sites, services and apps are getting much bigger; more views, more pages, more layouts, more browsers on more devices… It’s time we levelled up our CSS.</p>
<h3>Who is it taught by?</h3>
<p>Harry is a Consultant Front-end Architect, designer, developer, writer and speaker from the UK. Previously a Senior Developer at BSkyB, he now helps tech teams all over the world build better products.</p>
<p>He specialises in authoring and scaling large front-ends; he writes on the subjects of maintainability, architecture, performance, OOCSS and more at <a href='http://csswizardry.com'>csswizardry.com</a>; he is the lead and sole developer of <a href='http://inuitcss.com'>inuit.css</a>, a powerful, scalable, Sass-based, BEM, OOCSS framework; he Tweets at <a href='http://www.twitter.com/csswizardry'>@csswizardry<a/>.</p>

  <li>How to split designs up into discrete objects, abstractions and components.</li>

  <li>How to use Sass’ more humble features to tie things together.</li>
  <li>How to effectively manage layout.</li>
  <li>And anything more you think of on the day.</li>
