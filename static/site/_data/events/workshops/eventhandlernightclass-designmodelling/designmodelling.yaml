text: "<p>Join (link: https://twitter.com/jude_pullen text: Jude Pullen), award winning designer and engineer at Dyson UK on a full day design modelling workshop. Working from sketches; Jude will teach you how to make physical prototypes out of card, foam and plastic sheet.</p><p>Whether you&#39;re a table-top gamer, model railway builder, teacher, engineer, architect, set designer or product designer - we all need to communicate our ideas. Even more so when working with other people, we may need to adapt models quickly, often in mid-discussion. Like iterative sketches in pen and paper, much progress can be made with quick and effective sketch-model making, before finalising an idea. </p><p>You&#39;ll be provided with some case studies to work with to make a prototype, but please feel free to bring your own ideas, sketches or components to use. If you&#39;d like to know more about Jude&#39;s process and what may be covered in the workshop, you can take a look at his work here: (link: http://www.judepullen.com/designmodelling text: Design Modelling). </p><p>What you&#39;ll learn:</p><ul><li>How to turn your ideas into a final prototype</li><li>Techniques to handle cardboard, foam and plastic</li><li>The score and snap technique for modelling with acrylic</li><li>How to make curves, joints, folds and cuts. </li><li>How to use a glue gun to piece your work together</li></ul><p>If you have an idea of what you&#39;d like to prototype but have some questions or just want to know more, you can email us at (email: contact@eventhandler.co.uk). </p><p>(image: dm2.jpg class: full-width)</p><p>(image: dmevent.jpg class: full-width)</p><p>(image: dm3.jpg class: full-width)</p>"
