text: "<p>On Friday the 9th of May, <a href='http://www.twitter.com/davelab6' alt='Dave Crossland'>Dave Crossland</a> will be hosting a full-day 'Crafting Type' workshop in which you can learn the skills to start design your own type</p>
<p><img src='craftingtype.png'></p>
<p>Crafting Type is a workshop where absolute beginners learn how to design typefaces. This workshop will benefit anyone who does professional typography (using fonts, not making them). Previous attendees of the Crafting Type workshops come from established careers as artists, architects, and illustrators.</p>
<p>Learning type design is a great way to deepen your understanding of typography. Zooming in to this level of detail is still rare, and being able to drill down with clients and other designers sets you apart.</p>
<h3>Who is it taught by?</h3>
<p><a href='http://www.twitter.com/davelab6' alt='Dave Crossland'>Dave</a> is an English type designer, best known for creating the Cantarell typeface: a beautiful contemporary Humanist sans serif. Made while studying for over 2 years in the Department of Typography at the University of Reading (UK, 2009), Cantarell was chosen as the brand type for the GNOME desktop. Dave is currently ‘Font Consultant’ to <a href='https://www.google.com/fonts'>Google Fonts</a> and has commissioned hundreds of typefaces from designers around the world</p>
