text: "<p>After a successful year bringing you respected industry experts from around the world, we listened to your feedback and decided to take it a step further with talks that are bigger, more technical, and more hands-on. We think there should be more discussion and more idea sharing. We think there should be more WiFi and better coffee.</p><p>So this is our plan: 1 hour talks, projects to code along with, resources available online. Long breaks between talks to coffee up, network, carry on hacking and meet with speakers. No rubbish conference centre WiFi – we&#39;re building our own network just for you.</p>"
