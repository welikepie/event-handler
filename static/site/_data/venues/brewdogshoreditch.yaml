    (From the BrewDog Website at http://www.brewdog.com/bars/shoreditch)
    Our Bethnal Green Road bar encapsulates the unrelenting, 
    unforgiving surge of creativity that continues to fuel the area's journey to reinvention. 
    Antique tiles, reclaimed metal and a bar completely exposed by an unforgiving wall of 
    glass make this craft beer haven an icon in its own right. 
    All hipsters must be accompanied by an adult.
