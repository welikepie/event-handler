  text: "<p>After a successful year bringing you respected industry experts from around
    the world, we listened to your feedback and decided to take it a step further
    with talks that are bigger, more technical, and more hands-on. We think there
    should be more discussion and more idea sharing. We think there should be more
    WiFi and better coffee.</p><p>So this is our plan: 1 hour talks, projects to code
    along with, resources available online. Long breaks between talks to coffee up,
    network, carry on hacking and meet with speakers. No rubbish conference centre
    WiFi – we&#39;re building our own network just for you.</p>"

    of card, foam and plastic sheet.</p><p>Whether you&#39;re a table-top gamer, model
    railway builder, teacher, engineer, architect, set designer or product designer
    - we all need to communicate our ideas. Even more so when working with other people,
    we may need to adapt models quickly, often in mid-discussion. Like iterative sketches
    in pen and paper, much progress can be made with quick and effective sketch-model
    making, before finalising an idea. </p><p>You&#39;ll be provided with some case
    studies to work with to make a prototype, but please feel free to bring your own
    ideas, sketches or components to use. If you&#39;d like to know more about Jude&#39;s
    process and what may be covered in the workshop, you can take a look at his work
    here: (link: http://www.judepullen.com/designmodelling text: Design Modelling).
    </p><p>What you&#39;ll learn:</p><ul><li>How to turn your ideas into a final prototype</li><li>Techniques
    to handle cardboard, foam and plastic</li><li>The score and snap technique for
    modelling with acrylic</li><li>How to make curves, joints, folds and cuts. </li><li>How
    to use a glue gun to piece your work together</li></ul><p>If you have an idea
    of what you&#39;d like to prototype but have some questions or just want to know
    more, you can email us at (email: contact@eventhandler.co.uk). </p><p>(image:

  text: "<p>Join (link: https://twitter.com/jack_franklin text: Jack Franklin) for
    a London JS Night Class. In this workshop we&#39;ll see how Node.js can be used
    to build Command Line tools, look at the packages available on Node Package Manager
    (npm) and publish our own tools to npm, for anyone to use.</p><p>Node.js is a
    fantastic tool that was originally intended for server side JS but has grown to
    serve a number of purposes. With the Node Package Manager, it&#39;s a rich environment
    for developing command line tools that you can use to make your job easier. If
    you spot yourself performing the same mundane tasks over and over again, that&#39;s
    a great chance to abstract those into a small command line utility. Node is a
    great platform for doing this.</p><p>If you want to take part in this workshop,
    here&#39;s what you&#39;ll need:</p><ul><li>A Unix Laptop; a Mac or something
    that runs Linux</li><li>You need to be comfortable with basic JavaScript (variables,
    functions, conditionals, loops)</li><li>You need to be comfortable using the command
    line</li><li>Have Node (V0.8 and upwards) and Node Package Manager (npm) installed</li><li>Having
    experience writing scripts with Node.js is preferable but not essential</li></ul>"

    the work we do is not meant to be hanged on a wall for people to admire, nor is

    the work we do is not meant to be hanged on a wall for people to admire, nor is
    meant to be put in a drawer and forgotten about. Just as we make the products

    in a way that ensures that what you&#39;ve defined is easy to understand for the

    his toolset including PHP, HTML5, CSS &amp; JavaScript. He has created many popular
    image compression tools: (link: http://www.imageoptim.com text: ImageOptim), (link:
    http://www.pngmini.com text: ImageAlpha) &amp; (link: http://www.pngquant.org
    text: pngquant) and is a big fan of web-based game development and web standards.
    You&#39;ll find Kornel talking at meet-ups, events and international conferences.
    </p><h3>What you&#39;ll learn</h3><ul><li>The theory of Git: How it works and
    basic terms &amp; concepts.</li><li>How to commit, push, pull and move files.
    </li><li>How to undo mistakes</li><li>How to recover from the “strange and stupid”
    situations that arise when using Git</li><li>How to merge</li><li>How to rebase</li></ul><h3>Preparation</h3><ul><li>Please
    bring your laptop</li></ul><h3>Refund Policy</h3><p>If you discover that you are

    in mainstream browsers and on devices. This workshop will prepare you to use the
    latest CSS features for layout to get great looking results with cleaner code.</p><h3>Who

    can be enormously time-consuming. Learning how to work with paper prototypes—meta-versions

    it, and use that criticism to rework the design towards a finished product.</p><h3>Who

    Ruffles'>Tim Ruffles</a> and <a href='http://www.twitter.com/mattfieldy' alt='Matt
    Field'>Matt Field</a> will be hosting a workshop in which you can get to grips
    with Functional JavaScript.</p> <p><img src='funjs.png'></p> <h3>Who is it for?</h3>
    <p>Functional programming takes us back to basics: functions and data. Functions
    become our primary tool of abstraction and structure in our programs, transforming
    data in pipelines. This delivers real simplicity and lets us focus on solving
    problems, rather than obsessing over forcing programs into object hierarchies.</p>
    <p>How does functional programming differ from OOP? What are higher order functions?
    How do you get started with functional Javascript? Tim & Matt will answer these
    questions by taking you through the core concepts of FP, and guiding you through
    exercises to ensure the concepts stick.</p> <h3>Who is it taught by?</h3> <p>This
    workshop is being run by <a href='http://www.twitter.com/timruffles' alt='Tim
    Ruffles'>Tim Ruffles</a> and <a href='http://www.twitter.com/mattfieldy' alt='Matt

    alt='SideKickJS'>SidekickJS</a>, his code-quality tracking tool. Matt is a developer
    interested in a variety of things including JavaScript, Functional Programming,
    Clojure and (sipping) whisky. Together, they run the <a href='http://lanyrd.com/series/funjsldn/'

    cover</h3> <ul> <li>An introduction to Functional Programming</li> <li>Higher

    out of a talk or presentation with a rambling page of notes that will probably
    never be looked at again? Sketchnoting, also known as visual note taking, is a
    way of taking your notes and making them more memorable and interesting, while
    also distilling ideas down and providing an easier way to navigate through a tangle
    of ideas.</p> <p>In the workshop, we’ll start with the basics of sketching and
    build up to how to communicate your ideas effectively through sketching, as well
    as some techniques to listen and sketch at the same time, through theory, practice
    exercises, live sketching and group critiques.</p> <h3>Who is it taught by?</h3>

    workshop in which you can learn to use architect big-front ends</p> <p><img src='cssarchitecture.png'></p>
    <p>Ten years ago most websites were small affairs, with perhaps a handful of pages
    and very simple designs. Today, however, the majority of websites are very different
    beasts…</p> <p>There’s no denying that web-sites, services and apps are getting
    much bigger; more views, more pages, more layouts, more browsers on more devices…
    It’s time we levelled up our CSS.</p> <h3>Who is it taught by?</h3> <p>Harry is
    a Consultant Front-end Architect, designer, developer, writer and speaker from
    the UK. Previously a Senior Developer at BSkyB, he now helps tech teams all over
    the world build better products.</p> <p>He specialises in authoring and scaling
    large front-ends; he writes on the subjects of maintainability, architecture,
    performance, OOCSS and more at <a href='http://csswizardry.com'>csswizardry.com</a>;
    he is the lead and sole developer of <a href='http://inuitcss.com'>inuit.css</a>,
    a powerful, scalable, Sass-based, BEM, OOCSS framework; he Tweets at <a href='http://www.twitter.com/csswizardry'>@csswizardry<a/>.</p>
    <h3>What you'll cover</h3> <p>This full-day workshop shall give a whirlwind overview
    of:</p> <ul> <li>How to assess, normalise and rationalise designs.</li> <li>How
    to split designs up into discrete objects, abstractions and components.</li> <li>The
    ever pesky task of naming things.</li> <li>How to shear your codebase into flexible,
    extensible and manageable layers.</li> <li>The optimal architecture for a robust,
    extensible, scalable CSS codebase.</li> <li>How to use Sass’ more humble features
    to tie things together.</li> <li>How to effectively manage layout.</li> <li>And
    anything more you think of on the day.</li> </ul> <p>So much to cover, and such
    little time! Bring your laptop and your best CSS-game and let’s get cracking.
    It’s gonna be fun!</p> <h3>Requirements</h3> <ul> <li>Your **laptop** with:</li>
    <li>Text editor</li> <li>Sass</li> <li>Git(Hub)</li> <li>Photoshop (optional)</li>

    learn how to use the latest CSS features for layout. Prior experience of CSS is
    necessary; this is not an introduction.</p><p>Layout on the web is hard! Over
    time, web designers have developed tricks to bend <code>display: table</code>,
    <code>position: absolute</code> and floats to achieve layouts as desired. Often
    times this brings great pain, frustration and the responsive design approach makes
    work even harder.</p><p>Modern features for layout such as CSS Flexbox and CSS
    Regions significantly improve productivity and they&#39;re now becoming available
    in mainstream browsers and on devices. This workshop will prepare you to use the
    latest CSS features for layout to get great looking results with cleaner code.</p><h3>Who
    is it taught by?</h3><p>This workshop is being hosted by Razvan Caliman. Razvan
    is an engineer for the Adobe Web Platform, helping to build CSS Regions, CSS Shaders,
    CSS Shapes and more. His preferred title is &quot;web developer with a burning
    passion for open web technologies&quot;. He has given a number of talks at events
    and conferences (link: https://speakerdeck.com/razvancaliman text: about HTML5
    &amp; CSS3).</p><h3>What you&#39;ll learn</h3><ul><li>Visualising markup</li><li>Using
    CSS Flexbox for common layout use cases</li><li>Responsive layouts without media
    queries</li><li>Using CSS Regions for newspaper-like layout</li><li>Introduction

  text: "<p>Traditionally, UX Camp London is a once-a-year affair. But after this
    years event, we found it so awesome that we couldn&#39;t bare to wait a whole
    year for the next one. <strong>We&#39;ve decided to do UX Camp twice a year!</strong>
    Join us for our spring edition in early 2014.</p><p>(image: uxcamp.png class:
    full-width)</p><p>UX Camp London is a BarCamp focused on exploring user experience,
    where we come together to share ideas, get inspired and develop our skills. It
    boasts an eclectic mix of talks and discussions from seasoned UX’ers and novices
    alike; for anyone interested in user experience design, information architecture,
    usability and more. There are no set talks, nor any product pitches; the content
    of the day is shaped by all those who attend, anyone can hold a talk or host a
    discussion.</p><p>We want to make sure everyone has a chance of getting a ticket,
    so we&#39;re releasing them in batches over the coming weeks. - Batch One: Weds
    13th November- Batch Two: Weds 20th November- Batch Three: Weds 27th November</p><h2>What
    is a BarCamp?</h2><p>Unlike a traditional conference, a BarCamp is an event which
    is shaped by the attendees. Rather than having a day of scheduled speakers, you
    are given the opportunity to present yourself. The goal is to share what you know,
    learn from others and ignite discussion.</p><p>You create the schedule: at the
    start of the day anyone who wants to has the opportunity to sign up for a speaking
    slot. What you want to talk about is up to you! Previous sessions have been anything
    from “Live Wireframing” and “From post-its to personas” to “Visual Note Taking”
    and “A Hitchhikers guide to Gamification”.</p><h2>Who is it for?</h2><p>(image:
    whatis.png class: full-width)</p><p>UX Camp London is for anyone at all who is
    interested in User Experience.UX Camp has been host to a broad selection of attendees
    including seasoned UX practitioners who want to connect with other members of
    the field and trade ideas, designers and developers who want to learn more about
    another aspect of creating great products and services &amp; students who want
    to be more involved in the community and develop their skills.</p><h2>How can
    you get involved?</h2><p>BarCamps are a community effort and there are ways in
    which you can get yourself involved with UX Camp London. Apart from signing up
    to do a talk or encouraging others to do so, you can help us with the following.</p><h3>Sponsorship</h3><p>UX
    Camp London is a non-profit event, run by volunteers who give their time to organise
    the event and run it on the day. By providing the event with sponsorship you will
    help contribute to the costs of venue hire and any miscellaneous costs such as
    materials to present the talks (pens, paper, whiteboards).</p><p>If you choose
    to sponsor UX Camp, your brand will be exposed to the leading members of the industry.
    You will feature prominently in front of our delegates as well as being promoted
    to a wider audience in all of our conference material including the UX Camp London
    website, EventBrite &amp; Lanyrd page, posters at the event, all email correspondence
    between us and attendees and tweets from the (link: http://www.twitter.com/uxcamplondon
    text: @uxcamplondon) account.</p><p>If you&#39;re interested in sponsoring UX
    Camp London, get in touch with us at (email: contact@eventhandler.co.uk text:
    contact@eventhandler.co.uk)</p><h3>Volunteering</h3><p>UX Camp London has always
    been a volunteer run event. We need people to help us make sure everything runs
    smoothly; from set-up and take down to directing people to the right rooms. If
    you think you can volunteer some of your time to help, please email us at: (email:
