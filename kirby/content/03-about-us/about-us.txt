Title: About us
----
Text: Event Handler is geeks organising events for other geeks. For over a year now we've been running London JS and other tech events around London. We run the events based around a few simple ideas;

- An event is made by it's attendees 
- We want you to walk away having learned something
- We sell sponsorship not speaking slots


## Be excellent to each other

We are dedicated to producing the best events. To make the experience enjoyable for everyone – regardless of age, gender, sexuality, religious or ethnic identity – we expect our speakers and attendees to remember about these simple rules;

- Offensive behaviour (verbal abuse, intimidation, harassment etc.) will not be tolerated
- Offensive slide decks will not be tolerated
- Anyone acting like a jerk will be asked to leave
- If you find something offensive, let us know and we'll investigate it

Any feedback and suggestions how we can make our events more enjoyable and inclusive are welcome, so don't be shy.

    But... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat.

    The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math!
