text: When they kick at your front door How you gonna come? With your hands on your head Or on the trigger of your gun

When the law break in How you gonna go? Shot down on the pavement Or waiting on death row

You can crush us You can bruise us But you'll have to answer to Oh, the guns of Brixton
