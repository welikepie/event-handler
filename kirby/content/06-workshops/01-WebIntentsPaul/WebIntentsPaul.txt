Description: A workshop hosted by Paul Kinlan; a developer advocate at Google and creator of the Web Intent Specification. Web Intent is a framework that solves the problem of service integration. It allows inter-application communication, applications request to perform an action such as sharing an image or editing a post and the system will locate the appropriate service to handle such an action depending on the users set preferences. 
The workshop will be split into two halves; The first half will be an introduction to using Web Intents, encompassing basic exercises aimed at familiarising you with the Web Intents Framework. The second half will focus on aiding you to get Web Intents working with your own applications.
So if you're interested in making it so your application will work with a range of services and reach a wider audience, register your interest with the Web Intents workshop and we'll make it so.
