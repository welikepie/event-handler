Title: Workshops
----
Text: Since we've started doing events, we've always had the idea of holding workshops at the back of our minds.
As there is no time like the present, we're excited to say that we are doing just that, we will be organising
several workshops on all different subjects on a regular basis around London. 

Ideas we have been toying with include Arduino workshops, Paper Prototyping, an introduction to Web Intents 
and to the D3 framework. Take a look at the descriptions below, if you wish to take part in any of
them, please register your interest at the appropriate links!

If you have any suggestions for workshops to hold, or would like to do your own, 
Please contact us at (email: contact@eventhandler.co.uk text: contact@eventhandler.co.uk) or on Twitter at @eventhandleruk.
