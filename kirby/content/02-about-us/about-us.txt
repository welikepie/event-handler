## Be excellent to each other

We are dedicated to producing the best events. To make the experience enjoyable for everyone – regardless of age, gender, sexuality, religious or ethnic identity – we expect our speakers and attendees to remember about these simple rules:

- offensive behaviour (verbal abuse, intimidation, harassment etc.) will not be tolerated
- offensive slide decks will not be tolerated
- anyone acting like a jerk will be asked to leave
- If you find something offensive, let us know and we'll investigate it

Any feedback and suggestions how we can make our events more enjoyable and inclusive are welcome, so don't be shy.

    The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math!
