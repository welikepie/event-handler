## Refunds

If you discover that you are unable to attend the event you bought tickets for, we are happy to arrange a 100% refund for you as long as you notify us of your need for a refund a month before the event in question. 

## Ticket Transfers

If you cannot attend the event you bought tickets for but have a friend or coworker that you would like to go in your place, send an email to (email: contact@eventhandler.co.uk) with your name and the name of the person you'd like to transfer to the ticket to. We will transfer your ticket as long as you notify us of this at least 24 hours before the event goes ahead.

## Disabled Access

If you are attending one of our events and you have certain access requirements such as wheelchair access, hearing impaired requirements or sight impairment then contact us at (email: contact@eventhandler.co.uk) and we will do our best to facilitate your needs. 

## Photography

It is likely that we will be filming and photographing our events; your attendance of the event means you grant us permission to use your image for future purposes such as promotional material.
