* An eye for detail and an interest in new technologies (with an understanding of their limitations)
* Experience with responsive, HTML5, building for tablets, etc
* Experience with JavaScript. If you're a JS guru, even betterlevel

## Who are we looking for?

* A passionate, talented person
* Good communication skills - be able to talk to clients and internally get your point across
* Someone who loves working with frontend technology
* Someone who enjoys challenging, varied work

## Job Details

* Annual salary: up to Â£30k dependent on experience
* Probationary period: 3 months
* Performance review: 6 months continuously
* Holiday entitlement: 28 days including Christmas + bank holidays
