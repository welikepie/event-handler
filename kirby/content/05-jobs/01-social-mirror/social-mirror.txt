The developer will be working closely with the Royal Society of Arts and health practitioners, in conjunction with a developer at the MIT Media Lab, to refactor an existing prototype and bring it through several working, tested iterations, with the possibility of further work afterwards. Social Mirror is open source under the MIT license.
The ideal candidate will have experience in Backbone.js and PhoneGap, with some knowledge of server-side development. Especially good candidates will be able to apply lessons from Agile and Test Driven Development techniques to this project where applicable.
