Title: Senior Software Developer
----
Text:

The 20 strong development team is split into smaller teams, each with it's own dedicated product manager and always on hand, in-line QA. Each of these teams operate like their own start-up - empowered to make any decisions needed to get the job done.

## About MOO:

* We make life a little less virtual (we love the web, but you can't put it in your pocket).
* We help our customers create products like Business Cards, Postcards and MiniCards, making it easy for them to share information about themselves or their business in the real world.
* Unlike many tech companies, we make physical products, and they are used every day by hundreds of thousands of people around the world.
* We work with amazing partners including Facebook, Flickr, Etsy, LinkedIn, and YouTube.

## Responsibilities

Wondering what you would work on?

Well, it's difficult to say since the scope of our work is so varied. The work changes depending on the priority set by our product team.

To provide you with a taste of what the work may involve: had you joined the team back in January you would have worked on some (or all of) the following:

* Designing and delivering our new data model and PDF rendering process
* Creating and coding a brand spanking new "Accounts" section of the website
* Researching and releasing a custom algorithm to detect whether JPEGs are photographs or artwork
* Imagining and implementing the new version of the MOO API

We're currently working on something pretty interesting that involves CouchDB, and something else with Flash (sandwiched between a table football tournament or two).

## About you

We'd be over the moon if you:

* have a strong work ethic (whilst making time to have fun at the end of the day)
* know your interfaces from your abstract classes
* can draw an abstract factory on a whiteboard without breaking sweat
* hand on your heart, can honestly say you really understand the basics of HTTP and maybe what an RFC is
* search for that last line to get 100% code coverage with your unit tests
* have ever looked to see what the cyclometric complexity of your code is, just for fun
* can explain what CSRF is, and how to stop it

It wouldn't hurt if you:

* know a bit of PHP
* have dabbled with JQuery
* have written something in ActionScript
