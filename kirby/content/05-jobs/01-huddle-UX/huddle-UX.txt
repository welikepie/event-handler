Title: Senior Web (UX) Designer
----
Text:

Our product makes it easy for people to collaborate on content across all their devices. We need a magical user experience, providing simple, quick and ubiquitous access to people, information and tools. That experience begins in our insightful (naturally) product strategy and guides the development of our platform and API suite. Your job is to help us deliver a beautiful and usable user interface.

You're a designer who can also code. You're as adept with HTML5 and CSS3 as you are with typography, layout and colour theory. You're all about using responsive design and media queries to create adaptable pages that look awesome on all screens. You can work with wireframes, comps, and high-level requirements, and create beautiful, sensible design options that meet the brief. You're agile, creative, open to ideas and not afraid to speak up with your own.

## Key responsibilities

* Design beautiful, simple and usable webpages that work cross-platform
* Prototype designs directly in the browser where appropriate, and in Adobe suite where not
* Make conceptual prototypes for user-testing sessions
* Work nicely with our client-side developers to take your designs live
* Work within our agile environment, where you'll need to report on your progress every day
* Be quick to solve day-to-day issues, but design for the long-term
* Work from written or verbal briefs from the Product Manager and UX Lead
* Keep showing us the stuff we should be doing to make Huddle better
