Yay! If you are seeing this, the installation of Kirby worked :)
Now just give the links in the menu a try to see if URL redirection works as well.

Check out the docs: <http://getkirby.com/docs> if you run into any problems or send me an email: <bastian@getkirby.com>

Have fun with Kirby!

<p>We think Code Club is an awesome initiative. They need some help getting off the ground so we decided to donate 10% of all our ticket sales to them.</p>
