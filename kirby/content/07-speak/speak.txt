Title: Speakers

Text:

We want to invite you to speak for us. Regardless of whether you love arduino, knitting, chocolatiering or one-button console gaming, tell us what you're interested in and would like to talk about. If you're not a speaker, no fear, if you have a suggestion for who you'd like to see speak at an event or you just have a topic in mind then go ahead and nominate them.

No idea is a bad idea, it doesn't have to be a fully formed and detailed plan, it can simply be what you think would be fun. Your suggested speaker doesn't have to be an award-winning, top dog, not-a-dry-eye-in-the-house conference aficionado either. We'll take your suggestions and work with you to create something awesome.

It could be that you want to speak, but have never done it before and are unsure of yourself.
We will help you to improve your speaking skills by:

- Brainstorming some ideas with you to come up with a topic for your talk and a style for you to work with; be it lightning talk, lecture or workshop.
- Help you find an experienced speaker that can help you hone your presentation skills.
- Review your slide, offering advice on legibility, structure & style. You don't even have to create your own from scratch, we can provide you with a template to get you started.
- If there's something you need but we haven't listed it above, let us know and we'll do our best to help.

We can't do any of this unless you tell us what you want, so fill out the survey below!
