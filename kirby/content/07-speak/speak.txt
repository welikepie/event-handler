We want to invite speakers of all different areas to speak for us, we�re looking for new and old faces that have something exciting to talk about. Just tell us what you do, what you�re interested in and what you�d like to do for us. If you�re not a speaker, no fear, if you have a suggestion for who you�d like to see speak at an event or you just have a topic in mind then go ahead and nominate them in the survey.

No idea is a bad idea, it doesn�t have to be a fully formed and detailed plan of the exact ins and outs, just what you think would be fun. Nor does your speaker have to be an award-winning, top dog, not-a-dry-eye-in-the-house kind of person. We�ll take your suggestions and work with you to create something beautiful. 

It could be that you want to speak, but have never done it before. That�s also totally fine and we�re here to help. If you have something you�re knowledgeable about but don�t know what specifics you want to talk about, we can help you come up with some ideas. If speaking has never been your strong point but it�s something you want to work on, we have a whole host of resources we can share with you ranging from tips from other speakers to ideas on how to produce good presentation slides. 

In terms of becoming a great speaker, we can:
- Help you narrow your thoughts down into one golden talk idea. 
- Give you advice on how to find your inner speaker, such as what not to do, stories from new speakers just starting out and articles from long-time speakers about how they got to where they are now. We have a long list of resources at our fingertips to give to you. 
- Opportunities to be mentored by some of our seasoned speakers, happy to answer any of your questions and share their individual stories about how they became a confident speaker. 
- Advice on how to create a great presentation; how to lay out a good presentation that is readable and interesting without skimping on the information and how to grab your audience with the facts and allow them to follow along with what you are saying. We have presentation templates to share with you that you can use for your talks with us. 
- Absolutely anything at all, if it�s not listed above but it will help you along the way to speakerhood then just ask, we�re happy to give. 


We can�t do any of this unless you tell us what you want, so fill out the survey below!
