We've been planning this event for quite some time now and we're ready to finally tell you about it! Geek Lates is an evening of geeky entertainment and insight. Held in the hall of Central Foundation School just off of Old Street; there will be workshops, talks and other stands dotted around the place. We have a sketch notes workshop from Eva Lotta Lamm, (very) short story writing from James Wallis, Domestic Science with Helen Arney, Arduino workshops with Paul King and many more to be announced.
