### Who is it for?

This workshop is for web designers and developers looking to learn how to use the latest CSS features for layout. Prior experience of CSS is necessary; this is not an introduction.

Layout on the web is hard! Over time, web designers have developed tricks to bend `display: table`, `position: absolute` and floats to achieve layouts as desired. Often times this brings great pain, frustration and the responsive design approach makes work even harder.

Modern features for layout such as CSS Flexbox and CSS Regions significantly improve productivity and they're now becoming available in mainstream browsers and on devices. This workshop will prepare you to use the latest CSS features for layout to get great looking results with cleaner code.

### Who is it taught by?

This workshop is being hosted by Razvan Caliman. Razvan is an engineer for the Adobe Web Platform, helping to build CSS Regions, CSS Shaders, CSS Shapes and more. His preferred title is "web developer with a burning passion for open web technologies". He has given a number of talks at events and conferences (link: https://speakerdeck.com/razvancaliman text: about HTML5 & CSS3).
