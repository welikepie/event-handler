### Who is it for?

Have you ever walked out of a talk or presentation with a rambling page of notes that will probably never be looked at again? Sketchnoting, also known as visual note taking, is a way of taking your notes and making them more memorable and interesting, while also distilling ideas down and providing an easier way to navigate through a tangle of ideas.

In the workshop, we’ll start with the basics of sketching and build up to how to communicate your ideas effectively through sketching, as well as some techniques to listen and sketch at the same time, through theory, practice exercises, live sketching and group critiques.
 

### Who is it taught by?
