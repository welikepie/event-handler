Ten years ago most websites were small affairs, with perhaps a handful of pages and very simple designs. Today, however, the majority of websites are very different beasts…

There’s no denying that web-sites, services and apps are getting much bigger; more views, more pages, more layouts, more browsers on more devices… It’s time we levelled up our CSS.
 

### Who is it taught by?

Harry is a Consultant Front-end Architect, designer, developer, writer and speaker from the UK. Previously a Senior Developer at BSkyB, he now helps tech teams all over the world build better products.

He specialises in authoring and scaling large front-ends; he writes on the subjects of maintainability, architecture, performance, OOCSS and more at (link: http://csswizardry.com text: csswizardry.com); he is the lead and sole developer of (link: http://inuitcss.com text: inuit.css), a powerful, scalable, Sass-based, BEM, OOCSS framework; he Tweets at (link: http://www.twitter.com/csswizardry text: @csswizardry).

### What you'll learn

This full-day workshop shall give a whirlwind overview of:

* How to assess, normalise and rationalise designs.
* How to split designs up into discrete objects, abstractions and components.
* The ever pesky task of naming things.
* How to shear your codebase into flexible, extensible and manageable layers.
* The optimal architecture for a robust, extensible, scalable CSS codebase.
* How to use Sass’ more humble features to tie things together.
* How to effectively manage layout.
