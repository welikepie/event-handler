### Who is it for?

This workshop is suitable for anyone who wants to improve or learn about how to position and demonstrate the value of User-Centred Design (UCD) and User Experience (UX) in general. It suits both the novice and the more experienced practitioner, and though part of the class will cover how to present our work, this will also be of use for non-UX people, like product owners and account management.

### Who is it taught by?

The workshop is being hosted Anna Dahlström (link: http://www.twitter.com/annadahlstrom text: @annadahlstrom), an Information Architecture and User Experience consultant. Originally from Sweden, Anna lives and works in London. Having previously worked for Dare; she now works for Byflock and freelances part-time.

### What you'll learn

In this hands on workshop we'll walk through practical examples as well as how to demonstrate and position the value that UCD and continuous UX involvement brings, both to clients and internal stakeholder.

We'll look at how to tackle companies that still work in a waterfall approach where UX is seen as one stage and then handed over, as well as companies that are so development focused that UX and UCD comes in as an afterthought. We'll also look at some typical client situations related to selling in UCD and how to address them.

**Coming out of this workshop you will:**

* Know how to demonstrate the value of UCD and UX in general
* Know where UCD and UX should sit in the project process
* How to communicate the above to clients and the internal team
* Know how to adapt process and the work you do to the project and client in question
* Be equipped with tools for how to deal with tricky clients
* Learn the tools used to present your work and why this matters

### Requirements

* Just bring yourself!
