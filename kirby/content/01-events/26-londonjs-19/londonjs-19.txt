Title: London JS
----
Text: 

With all the new HTML5 APIs and node.js making waves in the backend, it's never been a better time to be a JavaScript developer.

London JS will (try and) meet on a Monday of each month to hear a couple of talks on the exciting new topics that are influencing our field, before retiring to the local pub.

This month, the talks will be:

* Chrome Extensions for Hackers - Cristiano Betta (link: http://twitter.com/cbetta text: @cbetta)
* Building Firefox OS Apps - Ruth John (link: http://twitter.com/rumyra text: @rumyra)
