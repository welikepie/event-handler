Join (link: https://www.twitter.com/jack_franklin text: Jack Franklin) in a workshop dedicated to exploring the possibilities of utilising JavaScript on the Command Line. 

There are so many great JS tools and utilities that are exclusively available on the command line. In this workshop we will look at how to set up a command line, including initial configuration, installing useful tools like Node and Node Package Manager (NPM), and then delve into more detail into a few of the most popular tools, including Grunt JS, Yeoman, Mocha, Bower and others.

If you want to take part in this workshop, here's what you'll need:

* A Unix Laptop; a Mac or something that runs Linux
* You must be and experienced JavaScript developer, having worked with TDD, BDD, MV* (Backbone for example) will be beneficial. 
* Node (V0.8 and upwards) and Node Package Manager (NPM) installed on your computer
