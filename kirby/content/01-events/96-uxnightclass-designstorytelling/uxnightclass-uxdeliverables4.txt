Storytelling has always played an important part in our societies and development throughout history. In the last few years it's gained attention as an important aspect in communicating and building engagement with a brand’s customer base. But storytelling is also an integral part of the design process and a tool that not only can help us define our content, but also how to display and interact with it.

In this workshop we’ll walk through how the art of dramaturgy - that is traditionally used in literature, theatre and film - can help define and prioritise requirements, features and the experience as a whole. Both across platforms and screens. We’ll also explore how storytelling can be used to guide page layouts, as well as the value it brings for modular design and dynamic publishing.

### Who is it taught by?

The workshop is being hosted Anna Dahlström (link: http://www.twitter.com/annadahlstrom text: @annadahlstrom), an Information Architecture and User Experience consultant. Originally from Sweden, Anna lives and works in London. Having previously worked for Dare; she now works for (link: http://www.byflock.com text: Byflock) and freelances part-time.
