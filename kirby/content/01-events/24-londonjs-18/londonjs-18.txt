Title: London JS
----
Text: 

With all the new HTML5 APIs and node.js making waves in the backend, it's never been a better time to be a JavaScript developer.

London JS will (try and) meet on a Monday of each month to hear a couple of talks on the exciting new topics that are influencing our field, before retiring to the local pub.

This months, the talks will be:

* Javascript & Kinect - Mairead Buchan (link: https://twitter.com/tiny_m text: @tiny_m)
* Shaders & Filters - Paul Lewis (link: https://twitter.com/aerotwist text: @aerotwist)
* Regular Expressions - Remy Bach (link: https://twitter.com/remybach text: @remybach)
