Title: UX Camp London - Spring 2014
----
Text:

Traditionally, UX Camp London is a once-a-year affair. But after this years event, we found it so awesome that we couldn't bare to wait a whole year for the next one. **We've decided to do UX Camp twice a year!** Join us for our spring edition in early 2014.

UX Camp London is a BarCamp focused on exploring user experience, where we come together to share ideas, get inspired and develop our skills. It boasts an eclectic mix of talks and discussions from seasoned UX’ers and novices alike; for anyone interested in user experience design, information architecture, usability and more. There are no set talks, nor any product pitches; the content of the day is shaped by all those who attend, anyone can hold a talk or host a discussion.

We want to make sure everyone has a chance of getting a ticket, so we're releasing them in batches over the coming weeks. 
- Batch One: Weds 13th November
- Batch Two: Weds 20th November
- Batch Three: Weds 27th November

## What is a BarCamp?

Unlike a traditional conference, a BarCamp is an event which is shaped by the attendees. Rather than having a day of scheduled speakers, you are given the opportunity to present yourself. The goal is to share what you know, learn from others and ignite discussion.

You create the schedule: at the start of the day anyone who wants to has the opportunity to sign up for a speaking slot. What you want to talk about is up to you! Previous sessions have been anything from “Live Wireframing” and “From post-its to personas” to “Visual Note Taking” and “A Hitchhikers guide to Gamification”.

## Who is it for?
