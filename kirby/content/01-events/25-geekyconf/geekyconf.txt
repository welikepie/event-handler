GeekyConf is a conference with an aim to inspire and entertain all those that attend. Over twenty speakers will be coming together to present lightning talks (ten minutes long) on that which they are passionate about.

Talk topics range from design to the morality and politics of Pirates and there will be mini workshops and other activities spread throughout the day. Coffee and Food will be provided and there will be an after-party! We hope we can keep your creativity brimming with this unique event for the broader web community.
