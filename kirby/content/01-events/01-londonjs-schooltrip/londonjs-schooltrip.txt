Title: London JS School Trip
----
Text: 

After a successful year bringing you respected industry experts from around the world, we listened to your feedback and decided to take it a step further with bigger talks, more technical & more hands-on. We think there should be more discussion and more idea sharing. We think there should be more WiFi & better coffee.

So this is our plan; 1 hour talks, projects to code along with, resources online. Long breaks between talks to coffee up, network, carry on hacking & meet with speakers. No rubbish conference centre WiFi, we're building our own network just for you.
