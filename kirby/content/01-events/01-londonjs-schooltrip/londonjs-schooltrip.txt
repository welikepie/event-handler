Title: London JS School Trip
----
Text: 

After a successful year bringing you respected industry experts from around the world, we listened to your feedback and decided to take it a step further with talks that are bigger, more technical, and more hands-on. We think there should be more discussion and more idea sharing. We think there should be more WiFi and better coffee.

So this is our plan: 1 hour talks, projects to code along with, resources available online. Long breaks between talks to coffee up, network, carry on hacking and meet with speakers. No rubbish conference centre WiFi – we're building our own network just for you.

      Image: /assets/images/mark.png
      Description: |
        A discussion on realtime, multi-device, rich-client applications. But how do you build a website that can do server-side rendering while also being a single-page app on the client-side? EyebrowJS is the template &amp; UI system used at State, a London-based startup building a global opinion network. It’s used for server-side rendering from a Node.js server and client-side magic. We’ll discuss how Eyebrow is architected and what it means for development.

      Image: /assets/images/irene.png
      Description: |
        As data becomes an integral part of our web application stack, traditional approaches to data fetching and manipulation may not be enough. In this session we will discuss the varying approaches one can take to building data-driven applications and the available libraries to support those approaches. From JSON requests to n-dimensional filtering, come learn what patterns might be useful in your workflow.

      Title: 'Key note:</br>What Can You Make?'
      Image: /assets/images/steph.png
      Description: |
        How well do we know this ephemeral material we use to craft websites, apps, and ultimately the web? How well do we know our powers and skills, as architects and engineers? And if we knew ourselves and our craft better, would we—could we—make more awesome things, or would it have the opposite effect?

        - Simulating user input to get top position on an online typing test :
        - Finding which tab in which window runs Soundcloud and stopping the music from the keyboard.

      Title: 'Alice.js: A Lightweight Independent CSS Engine'
      Image: /assets/images/luca.png
      Description: |
        An open source micro library simplifies doing advanced animations with CSS. It’s self contained and works directly against the DOM. The framework introduced the concept of Organics, adding randomization characteristics to create visual effects that are subtly different each time they play out. Used for games as well as regular business apps, AliceJS can help bring freshness and polish to your work.
