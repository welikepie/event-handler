Title: London JS 13
----
Text: 

With all the new HTML5 APIs and node.js making waves in the backend, it's never been a better time to be a JavaScript developer.

London JS will (try and) meet on a Monday of each month to hear a couple of talks on the exciting new topics that are influencing our field, before retiring to the local pub.

This months, the talks will be:

* Microframeworks - Dan Knell (link: https://twitter.com/danielknell text: @danielknell)
* Require.js - Tim Ruffles (link: https://twitter.com/timruffles text: @timruffles)
