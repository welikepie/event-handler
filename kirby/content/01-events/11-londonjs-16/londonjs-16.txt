Title: London JS
----
Text: 

With all the new HTML5 APIs and node.js making waves in the backend, it's never been a better time to be a JavaScript developer.

London JS will (try and) meet on a Monday of each month to hear a couple of talks on the exciting new topics that are influencing our field, before retiring to the local pub.

This months, the talks will be:

* Dojo Promises - Mark Wubben (link: https://twitter.com/novemberborn text: @novemberborn)
* JavaScript Engines - Peter Beverloo (link: https://twitter.com/beverloo text: @beverloo)
* jQuery - Addy Osmani (link: https://twitter.com/addyosmani text: @addyosmani)
