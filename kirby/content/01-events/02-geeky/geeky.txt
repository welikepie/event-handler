		<summary>Steph Troeth: What Can You Make?</summary>
		<p>How well do we know this ephemeral material we use to craft websites, apps, and ultimately the web? How well do we know our powers and skills, as architects and engineers? And if we knew ourselves and our craft better, would we—could we—make more awesome things, or would it have the opposite effect?

		<summary>Mark Wubben: EyebrowJS</summary>
		<p>A discussion on realtime, multi-device, rich-client applications. Single-page apps are the new black. But how do you build a website that can do server-side rendering while also being a single-page app on the client-side?

		EyebrowJS is the template and UI system used at State, a London-based startup building a global opinion network. It’s used for server-side rendering from a Node.js server and client-side magic, including managing UI, animations, page transitions and reactive data-binding. We’ll discuss how Eyebrow is architected and what it means for web application development.</p>

		<summary>Irene Ros: Building Client-Side Data-Driven Web Applications</summary>
		<p>As data becomes an integral part of our web application stack, traditional approaches to data fetching and manipulation may not be enough. In this session we will discuss the varying approaches one can take to building data-driven applications and the available libraries to support those approaches. From JSON requests to n-dimensional filtering, come learn what patterns might be useful in your workflow.</p>
