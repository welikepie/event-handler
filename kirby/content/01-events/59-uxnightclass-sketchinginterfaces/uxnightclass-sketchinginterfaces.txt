### Who is it for?

Sketching is a core skill and tool of any designer. It is a quick and cheap way to ideate, develop and iterate on possible design solutions, both alone and with a group.

We will take a closer look at when and how to use sketching in the design process and how to make your sketches communicate more clearly and efficiently. We will start with basic sketching techniques and build up the pace through a mix of theory, exercises, practise sessions and group critiques.

This workshop is ideal for Designers, Developers, Product Managers or anyone who is involved in creating websites or applications and wants to add sketching to their range of tools. 

**All skill levels are welcome and no previous sketching skills or knowledge are necessary.**
