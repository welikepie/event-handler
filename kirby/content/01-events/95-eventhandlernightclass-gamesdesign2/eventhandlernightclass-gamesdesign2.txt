In modern design, building stuff fast and getting to a working version are key, but making and testing prototypes (code or physical objects) can be enormously time-consuming. Learning how to work with paper prototypes—meta-versions of your design—to iterate the project quickly can save you days. In this workshop James Wallis will teach you to create and flesh out a concept for a simple multi-user system, build a working prototype, watch as other people test it and critique it, and use that criticism to rework the design towards a finished product.

### Who is it taught by?

This fun evening workshop is being hosted by James Wallis (link: http://www.twitter.com/jameswallis text: @jameswallis). James is a games designer and publisher who is behind popular games such as "Once Upon a Time" and "The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen". He runs "Spaaace", a games consultancy, and founded the Diana Jones award for excellence in gaming. Each year he runs (link: http://www.gamecamp.org.uk text: GameCamp).
