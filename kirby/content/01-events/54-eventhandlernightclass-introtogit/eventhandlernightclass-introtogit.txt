### Who is it for?
This workshop is for those who want to learn all the things they should have learned when they started out with Git. Go from being a complete beginner to highly proficient; learning the theory behind Git, all the necessary commands you need to get by and more advanced things like publishing patches and creating Git hooks. 

When git is saying "your working tree is dirty" it's not trying to offend you. Git's messages are written in Gittish and they're quite helpful once you get a Gittish-English dictionary.

The workshop will explain all operations needed to use git fluently: committing, pushing, pulling, merging and rebasing. Resolving conflicts, moving commits between branches, undoing changes. Advice on best practices and good workflow.

### Who is taught by?

This workshop is being taught by Kornel Lesinski (link: http://twitter.com/pornelski text: @pornelski), Senior Developer at BazaarVoice. Kornel is a developer with many languages in his toolset including PHP, HTML5, CSS & JavaScript. He has created many popular image compression tools: (link: http://www.imageoptim.com text: ImageOptim), (link: http://www.pngmini.com text: ImageAlpha) & (link: http://www.pngquant.org text: pngquant) and is a big fan of web-based game development and web standards. You'll find Kornel talking at meet-ups, events and international conferences.
