Title: London JS: Data Visualisation
----
Text:

With all the new HTML5 APIs and node.js making waves in the backend, it's never been a better time to be a JavaScript developer. London JS will (try and) meet on a Monday of each month to hear a couple of talks on the exciting new topics that are influencing our field, before retiring to the local pub.

**Tickets will be released on Thursday the 9th of January at 1PM.**
