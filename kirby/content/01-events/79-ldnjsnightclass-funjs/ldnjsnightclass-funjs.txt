Text:

### Who is it for?

Functional programming takes us back to basics: functions and data. Functions become our primary tool of abstraction and structure in our programs, transforming data in pipelines. This delivers real simplicity and lets us focus on solving problems, rather than obsessing over forcing programs into object hierarchies.
 
How does functional programming differ from OOP? What are higher order functions? How do you get started with functional Javascript? Tim & Matt will answer these questions by taking you through the core concepts of FP, and guiding you through exercises to ensure the concepts stick.

### Who is it taught by?

This workshop is being run by (link: http://www.twitter.com/timruffles text: Tim Ruffles) & (link: http://www.twitter.com/mattfieldy text: Matt Field).
