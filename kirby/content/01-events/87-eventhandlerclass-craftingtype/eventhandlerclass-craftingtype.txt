### Who is it for?

Crafting Type is a workshop where absolute beginners learn how to design typefaces. This workshop will benefit anyone who does professional typography (using fonts, not making them). Previous attendees of the Crafting Type workshops come from established careers as artists, architects, and illustrators.

Learning type design is a great way to deepen your understanding of typography. Zooming in to this level of detail is still rare, and being able to drill down with clients and other designers sets you apart.
 

### Who is it taught by?

Made while studying for over 2 years in the Department of Typography at the University of Reading (UK, 2009), Cantarell was chosen as the brand type for the GNOME desktop. Dave is currently ‘Font Consultant’ to (link: https://www.google.com/fonts text: Google Fonts) and has commissioned hundreds of typefaces from designers around the world.
