GeekyScience is an exciting evening of learning and entertainment. Each month, experts in their field will come together to share what they know, related to an overarching scientific theme that will change each month. GeekyScience is both curated and hosted by (link: http://www.twitter.com/helenarney text: Helen Arney), award-winning comedian and physics graduate. If you want to learn about the things that live deep within the ocean, how to make an asteroid or what an explosion scientist gets up to day-to-day; GeekyScience is something you don’t want to miss.

## Theme: Space

"Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind- bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space."
- Douglas Adams, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy

Our third edition of GeekyScience is all about SPACE! (link: http://www.twitter.com/saturnsheila text: Sheila Kenani) will be doing a whistle stop tour of the solar system, (link: http://www.twitter.com/skyponderer text: Colin Stuart) will be teaching us all about black holes and (link: http://www.twitter.com/lewis_dartnell text: Lewis Dartnell) will be informing us of what an Alien might look like. There will be asteroids! And more to be announced.
